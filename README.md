# The Mind of a Three-Year-Old

Welcome to "The Mind of a Three-Year-Old," a uniquely whimsical NFT collection by Unusual Circumstances. This project is built upon the creative and often unpredictable thoughts of an actual three-year-old, turning their imaginative words into visual, digital art pieces.

Each piece in the collection is part of a "subcollection," which is a group of artworks inspired by a single, unique prompt from a three-year-old. Every prompt sparks a series of derived artworks, each being a playful reinterpretation of the initial thought with their own charming quirks and twists.

Our first subcollection, for example, comes to life from the prompt, "we don't put toilet paper in our noses, we put paper towels in our shoes." This series of pieces spins a playful narrative, demonstrating the odd and imaginative ways a child might interpret the world around them.

The number of pieces within each subcollection doesn't follow any statistical standard but is whimsically determined by the decisions of the same three-year-old who provides the prompts. This leaves the collection with an unpredictable quantity that mirrors the unpredictable nature of a child's mind.

At its core, "The Mind of a Three-Year-Old" is an endeavor to explore and celebrate the unbounded creativity of a child's mind. We hope to share this journey with you and look forward to unveiling the charmingly unpredictable twists each new prompt will bring.
